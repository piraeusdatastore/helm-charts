# snapshot-validation-webhook

Deploys the [snapshot-validation-webhook](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter/#validating-webhook)
and configures your cluster to validate every `VolumeSnapshot` and `VolumeSnapshotContent` resource by sending it to
the webhook.

This webhook should be deployed on all clusters that are using the [`snapshot-controller`](../snapshot-controller) chart,
or are in the process of installing it.

## Usage

The following commands install this chart in your cluster. See [below](#configuration) for available configuration
options.

```
helm repo add piraeus-charts https://piraeus.io/helm-charts/
helm install snapshot-validation-webhook piraeus-charts/snapshot-validation-webhook
```

## Upgrades

Upgrades can be done using the normal Helm upgrade mechanism

```
helm repo update
helm upgrade snapshot-validation-webhook piraeus-charts/snapshot-validation-webhook
```


## Upgrade from older CRDs

In an effort to tighten validation, the CSI project started enforcing stricter requirements on `VolumeSnapshot` and
`VolumeSnapshotContent` resources when switching from `v1beta1` to `v1` CRDs. This webhook is part of enforcing
these requirements. When upgrading you [have to ensure non of your resources violate the requirements for `v1`].

The upgrade procedure can be summarized by the following steps:

1. Remove the old snapshot controller, if any (since you are upgrading, you probably already have one deployed manually).
2. Install this webhook chart.
3. Install the [snapshot controller](../snapshot-controller) using one of the [`3.x.x` releases]:

   ```
   helm install piraeus-charts/snapshot-controller --set image.tag=v3.0.3
   ```
4. Ensure that none of the resources are labelled as invalid:

   ```
   kubectl get volumesnapshots --selector=snapshot.storage.kubernetes.io/invalid-snapshot-resource="" --all-namespaces
   kubectl get volumesnapshotcontents --selector=snapshot.storage.kubernetes.io/invalid-snapshot-resource="" --all-namespaces
   ```

   If the above commands output any resource, they have to be removed

5. Upgrade the CRDs

   ```
   kubectl replace -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter/v5.0.0/client/config/crd/snapshot.storage.k8s.io_volumesnapshotclasses.yaml
   kubectl replace -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter/v5.0.0/client/config/crd/snapshot.storage.k8s.io_volumesnapshots.yaml
   kubectl replace -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter/v5.0.0/client/config/crd/snapshot.storage.k8s.io_volumesnapshotcontents.yaml
   ```

6. Upgrade the [snapshot controller](../snapshot-controller) to the latest version:

   ```
   helm upgrade piraeus-charts/snapshot-controller --set image.tag=v5.0.0
   ```

## Configuration

Webhooks in Kubernetes are required to run on HTTPS. To that end, this charts needs to be configured with one of the
following options:

* An auto-generated certificate, valid for 10 years. This is the default. If you want to renew the certificate,
  set `tls.renew` to `true` and run an upgrade.

* A [cert-manager.io](https://cert-manager.io) issuer able to create a certificate for the webhook service.

  To use this method, create an override file like:
  ```
  tls:
    certManagerIssuerRef:
      name: internal-issuer
      kind: ClusterIssuer
  ```

  To apply the override, use `--values <override-file>`.

* A pre-existing  [`kubernetes.io/tls`] secret and the certificate of the CA used to sign said tls secret.

  To use this method, set `--set tls.certificateSecret=<secretname>`.
  The secret must be in the same namespace as the deployment and be valid for `<release-name>.<namespace>.svc`.

There are additional options that allow customization outside of HTTPS concerns. This is the full list of options
available.
